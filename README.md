# Beans

## Plans
I want Beans to listen through vocal and command line prompts. He'll default to command 
line if launched through the terminal, but I'll make a PyInstaller executable that defaults
to listening for vocal prompts.

He'll use ```smolagents``` for most of his functions (because it's just too useful). 
He'll use OpenAI's ```whisper``` on Tiny to hear people. 

Beans should be able to Google stuff and tell acurrate time, weather, temperature, etc. 

Beans should be able to read and write code. 

Beans should have a "Tutor" mode, which puts limits on writing code but answers questions 
and gives guidance.

Beans should have a memory system that includes dynamic knowledge at Beans' discretion 
and hard-coded user details like location.
